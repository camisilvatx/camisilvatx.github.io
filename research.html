							<h2>X-ray Observations of Supernovae</h2>
							<p> Early in my undergraduate career, I analyzed X-ray observations of supernovae. In this work, I developed proficiency with the <a href="https://cxc.cfa.harvard.edu/ciao/" target="_blank">CIAO</a> software suite to analyze <em>Chandra</em> data, producing light curves and spectral diagnostics. This experience sparked my interest in computational methods and motivated me to pursue deeper technical training.</p>

							<h2>X-ray Galaxy Cluster Simulations at Fermilab</h2>
							<p>As a Metcalf Fellow at Fermilab, I worked with Dr. Brian Nord to develop a simulation pipeline for X-ray galaxy clusters designed to generate synthetic datasets for machine-learning–based mass inference. Because galaxy clusters trace the universe's matter distribution and expansion history, accurate mass measurements are critical for constraining cosmological parameters. I restructured components of the <a href="https://hea-www.cfa.harvard.edu/soxs/" target="_blank">SOXS</a> package into a flexible Python pipeline capable of producing large ensembles of simulated clusters with minimal manual intervention, redesigning data storage and file I/O to enable efficient catalog generation. This project trained me to read and modify large codebases and design reproducible research tools.</p>

							<h2>Gravitationally Lensed Galaxies with COOL-LAMPS</h2>
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/mag.JPG" alt="My COOL-LAMPS collaboraters and I at the Magellan Telescopes during March 2024 observing run" /></span>Building on these computational skills and my growing interest in how dark matter shapes galaxy evolution, I joined Professor Michael Gladders' strong gravitational lensing group at the University of Chicago as part of the <a href="https://coollamps.github.io/" target="_blank">COOL-LAMPS</a> collaboration. I identified strongly gravitationally lensed systems in wide-field survey data, performed morphological modeling with GALFIT to extract structural parameters and multiband photometry for cluster mass modeling, and refined the photometric calibration pipeline by recalculating zero-points and correcting misaligned Source Extractor outputs. I conducted <a href="https://news.uchicago.edu/story/atop-chilean-mountain-undergraduate-students-make-cutting-edge-astronomical-observations" target="_blank">four nights of observing</a> at the Magellan Telescopes in March 2024, using IMACS, FIRE, and LDSS3 for spectroscopy and imaging of lensed systems.</p>

							<h2>Submillimeter Galaxy Morphology with JWST</h2>
							<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/aas245.JPG" alt="Myself presenting in AAS245" /></span> I completed an NSF-funded REU at the University of Texas at Austin with Professor Caitlin Casey and Dr. Jed McKinney, investigating the internal structure of submillimeter galaxies using JWST NIRCam imaging. I applied GALFIT modeling and ellipse-fitting techniques to carry out the largest systematic search to date for stellar bars in SMGs at <em>z</em> &gt; 1, confirming five barred systems, including the most extended and highest-redshift unlensed barred galaxies currently known. I also conducted four nights of imaging observations of luminous infrared galaxies at the 2.1m telescope at McDonald Observatory. This work was published in <em>The Astrophysical Journal</em> and presented at AAS 245, and I am preparing a first-author manuscript expanding these results.</p>

					<!-- Queue Optimization Section -->
					<section class="wrapper style2 fade-up">
						<div class="inner" style="overflow: auto;">
							<h2>Telescope Queue Optimization</h2>
							<p>In my final months at UChicago, I returned to questions of observatory operations with Professor Michael Gladders on telescope queue optimization. I built a <a href="https://github.com/camisilvatx/telescope-queue-sim" target="_blank">minute-by-minute simulation</a> of Gemini South's nightly observing queue to compare traditional condition-based scheduling with signal-to-noise–based strategies, incorporating realistic seeing forecasts to evaluate observing efficiency and maximize scientific return from limited telescope time.</p>

							<h2>Current Research at UC Santa Cruz</h2>
							<p>
							Since beginning my PhD at UC Santa Cruz in fall 2025, I have continued to build observational expertise through five nights of near-infrared spectroscopy and imaging with the Nickel and Shane Telescopes at Lick Observatory.
